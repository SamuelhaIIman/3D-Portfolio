# 3D PORTFOLIO
## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## About

In my React + Vite 3D Portfolio project, I am embarking on a solo journey to craft a dynamic and immersive online showcase of my work. Fueled by the powerful combination of React for the user interface and Vite for a lightning-fast development environment, this endeavor aims to push the boundaries of traditional portfolios. The overarching goal is to seamlessly integrate 3D models into the website, elevating the user experience and providing a visually captivating representation of my skills and accomplishments.
