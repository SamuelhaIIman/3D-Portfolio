# 3D PORTFOLIO
## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## About

In my React + Vite 3D Portfolio project, I am embarking on a solo journey to craft a dynamic and immersive online showcase of my work. Fueled by the powerful combination of React for the user interface and Vite for a lightning-fast development environment, this endeavor aims to push the boundaries of traditional portfolios. The overarching goal is to seamlessly integrate 3D models into the website, elevating the user experience and providing a visually captivating representation of my skills and accomplishments.

Undertaking this project solo allows me to not only showcase my technical proficiency but also demonstrate my ability to conceptualize, design, and implement a unique and engaging online presence. By leveraging the latest technologies in the web development ecosystem, I aim to create a portfolio that not only stands out aesthetically but also serves as a testament to my adaptability and creativity. Through this endeavor, I am not only testing the capabilities of 3D models on a website but also forging a distinctive digital space that reflects my identity as a skilled and innovative professional.
