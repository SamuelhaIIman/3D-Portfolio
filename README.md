# 3D PORTFOLIO
## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Getting started

`npm install --legacy-peer-deps three`

`npm create vite@latest ./ -- --template react`

## About

Embarking on a solitary expedition within the realm of my React + Vite 3D Portfolio project, I am ardently endeavoring to fashion an unparalleled, dynamic, and immersive online showcase that transcends the conventional boundaries of portfolios. Fueled by the potent amalgamation of React, orchestrating the user interface with finesse, and Vite, facilitating a development environment characterized by its lightning-fast agility, this ambitious undertaking seeks to redefine the very essence of digital portfolios.

The overarching objective is to seamlessly weave the intricate tapestry of 3D models into the fabric of the website, thereby not merely showcasing my skills and accomplishments but elevating the user experience to unprecedented heights. The union of React and Vite acts as the catalyst propelling this project into uncharted territories, where the convergence of cutting-edge technologies and innovative design principles converge to create a virtual showcase of unparalleled sophistication.

By embarking on this solo odyssey, I not only aim to showcase my technical prowess but also to illuminate the depth of my ability to conceptualize, design, and implement a digital space that is both distinctive and engaging. This endeavor is not merely a showcase of skills but a testament to my adaptability, creativity, and unwavering pursuit of excellence in the ever-evolving landscape of web development.

In leveraging the latest technologies within the web development ecosystem, this project serves as a canvas for my dedication to pushing the boundaries of what is conceivable. It is not just about integrating 3D models; it is about the meticulous fusion of technology and artistry, resulting in a portfolio that transcends the mundane and stands as a beacon of innovation.

This solo expedition is not confined to testing the capabilities of 3D models within a website; it is about the creation of a distinctive digital space that serves as a reflection of my identity as a skilled and innovative professional. It is a manifestation of my commitment to carving out a niche that is not just aesthetically pleasing but also resonates with a profound sense of authenticity. As each line of code weaves itself into the digital tapestry, it is a testament to the journey towards creating an immersive, technologically advanced, and visually captivating representation of my skills and achievements.
